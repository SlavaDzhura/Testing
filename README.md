# Testing
My testing tasks (Feb 2015)

Task #1:

Change a phone number to an international format.
Example: number like (012) 535 14 71 should be changed into +38012 535 14 71.

Task #2:

Write the function that recursively finds the minimal element of an array.

Task #3:

Write a function that returns the element that has the value closest to the mean of an array. If there for example two values with the same difference that one that less should be returned. For example if numbers 4 and 6 have the same difference from the mean then 4 should be returned.

Task #4:

Given two Stack objects s1 and s2. Using them create an object Queue q1.
